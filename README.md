# CIS543-Programming-for-Data-Analytics Project

Group: Mariah Bastos, Nicholas Rivera, Li Huaikuan

Week 1:
 
Main Topic:

Our main topic is COVID conspiracy. 

Objective:
Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic many questions were asked that nobody had the answer for. Those doubts together with people spending more time at their houses and online led to the creation of many conspiracy theories about the creation of the COVID virus. Our objective with the project is to find out how prevalent is the disbelief in the COVID virus in the United States. We will also be looking to see if there is an association with incredulity towards the virus and unfavorable views of the people in the United States towards China and the Chinese Government. And if the initial behavior of the Chinese government contributes towards conspiracies and disbelief of the Americans towards the virus. 

Steps to obtain data:
We will collect the twitter data that mention COVID. We will then convert our data to a data frame and filter our data to select only the ones that mention COVID and conspiracy since COVID is a trendy topic and there will be a lot of information that won't be useful to us. We will then separate the data into positive and negative. The positive will represent the tweets that show a belief in the conspiracy theories of COVID. Our dependent variable is if people think COVID is a conspiracy or not. The independent variables are education level, religion, gender, age and location. 
We are going to collect data from twitter from the past 7 days about what people think of the virus, if it is a conspiracy or not, and the characteristics of the people commenting about it, such as age, gender, location and so on. After we collect the data, we will mutate new columns to represent peoples' sentiment as positive and negative, then we will run the regression or other models to analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Week 2:
 
Share any changes that you had to make from the original plan during the process of your project.
The only  change we really had to make from the original plan was to add some more specific hashtags that relate Coronavirus with China since there are many tweets happening everyday talking about COVID and not all of them are useful to our project. 
Share any difficulties that you have encountered during the process and how you resolved them.
We had some difficulty deciding what to run, the syntax of the code. We also had some trouble to store the large amount of data that we are gathering. We were able to get to a decision about which # we would focus on in order to filter our data to the ones that we are interested in, that are the ones about China and COVID. For that we decided to run on top of the basic COVID hashtags, #ChinaVirus, #ChineseVirus, #WuhanCoronavirus, #KungFlu, and #CCPVirus. And in order to gather all the data we found the solution of  running the code that saves the data as an Excel file. Posting on AWS will be also a challenge we will face because we have very little SQL knowledge and we haven't figured it out yet how we are going to do it.
